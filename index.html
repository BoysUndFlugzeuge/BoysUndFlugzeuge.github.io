  <p>Hello pilot, welcome to the Boys und Flugzueg website!</p>
  <h2 id="about">About us</h2>
  <p>We are a group of Girls und Panzer enthusiasts who felt that the series had room for expansion (And not in the conventional fanfiction manner).</p>
  <p>Girls in tanks was a pretty cool concept, then we got thinking...<br>"What if there were boys in planes too?"<br>"That would be pretty cool."</p>
  <p>Our collective group consists of regular people like yourself, people who have crazy ideas and a hankering for more content out of our favorite animes.<br>We are students, workers, wage slaves and freeloaders who wanted to put out a collective piece of artwork that an entire community of people can enjoy.</p>
  <p>This project has been a large part of our lives, dragging us through thick and thin, highs and lows.<br>Through constant perseverance (And a collective council of leaders) we have managed to slam together what we believe to be our groups best work.</p>

  <p>These past few years have been challenging for all involved so we implore you, our readers, to give us some feedback on our <a href="https://discord.gg/WWHfjkFmnW">discord server</a>, it'd be pretty nice if you could.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy your stay and our work.</p>
